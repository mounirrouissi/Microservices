# Microservice Project using Spring Cloud

This project demonstrates a practical microservices architecture using Spring Cloud. It covers various aspects of a microservice architecture including service discovery, centralized configuration, distributed tracing, circuit breaker patterns, and event-driven architecture.

## Features

- **Service Discovery**: Implemented using Spring Cloud's Eureka Server, allowing microservices to register themselves and discover other services.
- **Centralized Configuration**: Managed through Spring Cloud Config Server, providing a central place for externalized configuration in a distributed system.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Integrated with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin for distributed tracing to help debug and understand the system's behavior.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Utilizes the Hystrix library to implement the Circuit Breaker pattern, which helps to prevent system failure and ensure continued operation.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Leverages Spring Cloud Stream to create an event-driven architecture.
